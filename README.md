Prototype chat bot for my Twitch channel.

Tinkering with functionality and various commands/interactions with viewers.

TODO:

- Netstat and Adminer memes
- Auto-generate poll when people recommend boxes
- ?exec command

NOTES:

- Current netstat command kind of sucks and is a placeholder. I'll improve it later.
- Need to work out those config load issues.
